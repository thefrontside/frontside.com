      <p><em>We only share information with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services, to protect your rights, or to fulfill business obligations.</em></p>
      <p>We may process or share your data that we hold based on the following legal basis:</p>
      <ul role="list">
        <li><strong>Consent:</strong> We may process your data if you have given us specific consent to use your personal information for a specific purpose.</li>

        <li><strong>Vital Interests:</strong> We may disclose your information where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding potential violations of our policies, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person and illegal activities, or as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>More specifically, we may need to process your data or share your personal information in the following situations:</p>
      <ul role="list">
        <li><strong>Business Transfers.</strong> We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company</li>
      </ul>
      <p>‍</p>
      <h2><strong>4. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?</strong></h2>
      <p><em>We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your information.</em></p>
      <p>We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to access or store information. Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in our Cookie Notice.</p>
      <p><br></p>
      <h2><strong>5. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</strong></h2>
      <p><em>We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.</em></p>
      <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than 1 year.</p>
      <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
      <p><br></p>
      <h2><strong>6. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</strong></h2>
      <p><em>We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</em></p>
      <p>We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Website is at your own risk. You should only access the Website within a secure environment.</p>
      <p><br></p>

By using the Website, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependentâ€™s use of the Website. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at privacy@frontside.com.</p>
      <p><br></p>

You can find their contact details here: <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm">http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm</a>.</p>

      <h2><strong>9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</strong></h2>
      <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (&quot;DNT&quot;) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice. </p>
