          <strong class="block text-center">Pipeline Monitor Plugin</strong>

          In this workshop, we’ll build a Pipeline Monitor plugin to
          pull information from external services and aggregate that
          information in a database. The plugin will allow your users
          to customize it via YAML. The functionality of the YAML
          syntax will be configurable with custom functions in the
          backend. We’ll create a backend plugin engine that will use
          configuration from the YAML file to execute pipeline
          monitoring by polling each state of the pipeline, retrieving
          the status, and storing the status in the database. We’ll
          implement a mechanism for generating and storing information
          summaries in the database. The raw data about the pipeline
          and the status will be accessible via the backend REST
          API. We’ll write a front-end plugin that will show
          information from the database.
