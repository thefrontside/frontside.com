imgAlt: Portrait of Taras. He has long straight hair. He has no beard in this picture but usually fashions a short stubble.
intro: Taras began his journey into the realm of digital technology
  when in early 2000s his first clients started asking him to
  build websites. He quickly realized that rather than go it alone
  how much more satisfying it was to bring together cross
  disciplinary teams to work collaboratively towards common goals.
  At Frontside, Taras creates and nourishes relationships among
  his team, clients and partners to achieve ambitious long-term
  objectives.
