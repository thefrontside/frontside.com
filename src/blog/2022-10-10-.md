One of the most common questions from early adopters of Backstage is ‚Äúhow to get people to start using the software catalog?‚Äù Adopters of Backstage asking this question find themselves in a chicken and eggs situation - developers need a populated catalog to get value from a software catalog, but it requires developers to start using the software catalog to populate it. How do you break this cycle?

In this blog post, I‚Äôll describe approaches that successful Backstage adopters used to get traction with their Backstage catalog adoption. In the process, I‚Äôll explain how Backstage works to help you understand which approach is best for your organization. We‚Äôll cover bootstrapping the catalog with three approaches

1. Using a multi-document YAML file
2. Using pull-requests
3. Using an entity provider

Before we can start populating the catalog, we need a source of data that will be a useful starting point. One place to start is to populate the catalog with repositories from your version control system. For this tutorial, we‚Äôll use GitHub. A similar approach should work for other repository hosts. GitHub provides a [CLI](https://cli.github.com) that we can use to get a list of all of the repositories in the organization. We‚Äôll use the following command in our examples to generate a list of repositories with useful fields.

```sh
gh repo list <org_name> \
  --limit=1000 \
  --json=description,url,name,owner \
  --template=<output_template>
```

The `--template` flag can be used to control what the result will look like. It uses Go template format with a limited number of output functions so this approach might not scale for complex formatting. You may need to find another formatter, but it‚Äôll be sufficient to explain the different approaches.

### Using a multi-document YAML file

The Backstage catalog has a mechanism for ingesting catalog components from files. This mechanism is used to read catalog-info.yaml files and keep the catalog up to date. You can find documentation about it in [Static Location Configuration](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/configuration#static-location-configuration) section of Backstage documentation. The static location configuration requires a URL that contains the component‚Äôs metadata. You can see a bunch of static locations configured in [Backstage‚Äôs demo app](https://github.com/backstage/demo/blob/master/app-config.yaml#L42-L71). It may not be obvious that this can be used to import multiple components from the same file by using a multi-document YAML file. A multi-document YAML file is a YAML file that uses `---` separator to break up the document. You can use this to create a single file that contains multiple YAML document. Here is an example of such a document.

```yaml
apiVersion: backstage.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metdata:
  name: backstage
  description: |
    Backstage is an open-source developer portal that puts the developer experience first.
  annotations:
    github.com/project-slug: backstage/backstage
spec:
  type: library
  owner: CNCF
  lifecycle: experimental
---
apiVersion: backstage.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metdata:
  name: demo
  description: An example deployment of a Backstage application.
  annotations:
    github.com/project-slug: backstage/demo
spec:
  type: website
  owner: backstage/maintainers
  lifecycle: experimental
---
```

Using this technique, you can import many components from a single file. To generate this file, we can use GitHub CLI and a template that‚Äôll create a single file with all repositories formatted in the catalog entity format. Check out this [gist](https://gist.github.com/taras/3e480d84d38c2ec3f0f758c279a943b9#file-get_all_repoes) with a script that will create a component.yaml file.

```sh
gh repo list <org_name> \
  --limit=1000 \
  --json=description,url,name,owner,nameWithOwner \
  --template '{{range $index, $doc := .}}
apiVersion: backstage.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: {{ $doc.name }}
  description: |
    {{ $doc.description }}
  annotations:
    github.com/project-slug: {{ $doc.nameWithOwner}}
spec:
  type: library
  owner: {{ $doc.owner.login }}
  lifecycle: experimental
  --{{end}}' > components.yaml
```

We can use the generated components.yaml file with a static location to ingest all of these components into Backstage. To make this file available to your Backstage instance, you could upload this file to a repository and reference the file in the repository for your location.

```yaml
// app-config.yaml
  catalog:
    locations:
      - type: url
        target: https://github.com/my-org/my-repo/blob/main/components.yaml
```

Backstage will read this file and create a component for each YAML document in your component.yaml file. Backstage will automatically update components when this file is changed. You can re-run this script to update the description of components. New repositories will automatically get added and deleted repositories will be removed.

This approach can be an easy and quick way to populate your catalog. You can even automate updating the catalog by creating a GitHub Action workflow that will trigger on a cron to rerun this script and push the updated file into the repository. Bootstrapping the catalog with a multi-document YAML file generated from a script works well for a proof of concept but it becomes inconvenient when you have users who want to manage the metadata of their catalog components. We can do this by adding a catalog-info.yaml file by creating a pull request into each repository. This will be the next approach that‚Äôll cover.

### Using Batch Changes to open pull-requests

Backstage Software catalog is designed to empower developers to own the metadata of components they use. It provides a GitOps-friendly way of pulling component metadata from repositories into the catalog‚Äôs database. Information like component name, owner, type, and other metadata can be described via a catalog-info.yaml file. Developers can edit this file in their repository and Backstage will automatically read the changed file to update the metadata in the database.

When setting up backstage initially, and to avoid the chicken-and-egg problem described above, we can bootstrap creating those catalog-info.yaml with Sourcegraph Batch Changes. We will automatically open PRs against every repository to add catalog-info.yaml, then make sure they get merged from the Batch Changes dashboard.

The benefit of this approach is that repository owners can either just merge the pull request without additional work, or tweak it before merging. Repo owners might want to add update the description, add links or change the owner in the pull request before merging the PR.

Let‚Äôs see what this batch change would look like. Batch changes are described by a spec, that consist of three main parts parts:

- A search query
- Steps to execute to generate the diff
- A pull request template

Here‚Äôs the spec for adding backstage:

```
[INSERT SPEC](https://github.com/sourcegraph/batch-change-examples/blob/main/utils/add-backstage-github.batch.yaml)
```

Let‚Äôs zoom in on the steps section. A batch change works by running any number of steps to generate a diff. Each step corresponds to running a container on the target code. This spec has a single step, that will install the GitHub CLI to get the metadata we need about the repo, then run a small python script to format it.

We use a few utilities to keep things clean:

- In order to run the GitHub CLI, we need to authenticate, which is done by setting an environment variable with [env](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/batch_changes/references/batch_spec_yaml_reference#steps-env) and assumes that GH_TOKEN is available locally when running the spec.
- In order to keep things cleaner, we provide the script as a separate [file](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/batch_changes/references/batch_spec_yaml_reference#steps-files), that will be mounted on the container at runtime.

Running this spec in Sourcegrap Batch Changes will create PRs adding catalog-info-yaml to all the repositories matching the search query. You can then track those PRs from the Batch Changes dashboard.
