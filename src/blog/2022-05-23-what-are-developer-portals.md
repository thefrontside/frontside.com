A developer portal is an application or user interface that works as a meeting point for all the digital resources and information an organization may need. It is like an interactive operation center that centralizes all the tooling, APIs, and SDKs. Developer portals turn out to be an essential tool for helping teams communicate better, access relevant context, and improve relationships among developers and teams.

Read on to learn more about what to look for in a developer portal for your team. But to fully understand what developer portals can do for an organization, we first need to explore the concept of Developer Experience (DX).

### DX: The Basics

DX is a comprehensive concept that includes technology, working practices, and organizational leadership. DX aims to help developers navigate complexity by offering developers a smooth and effortless user experience so they can productively concentrate on what they do best.

We can measure development productivity not only with hard metrics such as velocity and efficiency but also via soft metrics like every contributor's impact on the goals, belonging to the team, and psychological safety.

A developer portal is an essential part of building a good development experience (DX) because it injects organizations with the necessary transparency and agility to better face development challenges. The design of a good developer portal therefore reflects the importance of both kinds of metrics.

To learn more about DX and explore our in-depth definition of it check our [previous blog post on the topic](https://frontside.com/blog/2022-01-26-what-is-dx/)!

### What are developer portals?

The movement toward developer portals began with the emergence of microservices, the cloud, and the Bring Your Own Tool (BYOT) movement. These in turn spawned the appearance of the next generation of tools (and the evolution of older ones) that functioned even better in this quickly changing development environment. All of these changes spoke to the desire of developers to have at their fingertips everything they needed for a productive DX.

Developer portals ultimately arose to make it easy for all the stakeholders to understand their available resources, including digital assets and works in progress. Teams find the tangible experience of interactive portals and apps appealing, while organizations value the transparency portals offer regarding ownership and dependencies of projects and products under development. A portal offers a single UI that unifies all company's infrastructure tooling, services, and documentation so that development teams are all *“singing from the same sheet of music.”*

Even though developer portals include documentation and onboarding kits, they are not a knowledge base or a playbook. Nevertheless, developer portals are not only good for business but especially for tech teams. The result of adopting a portal is that engineers spend less time looking for tools, catching up on internal standards or searching for who to talk to in order to resolve issues. Instead, they use this time to do what they do best – code and release product improvements.

### What makes a good developer portal?

As part of the DX efforts within a company, any good developer portal should offer the following:

- Give teams a view of resources across the company
- Decrease spending by eliminating the duplicated tasks or services
- Improve standardization
- Help teams auto-identify the services they need
- Make ownership visible to everyone

Developer portals typically tackle these issues by incorporating an intuitive interface, offering excellent onboarding workflows and beautifully designed control dashboards, and most of all including a powerful Services Catalog feature.

### Services catalog and plugins

The Services Catalog is a powerful feature in the heart of any developer portal. As its name suggests, it is an organized, well-documented, and easy-to-understand list of all the digital resources of a team or organization.

As the portal’s end-users, developers can reuse or rebuild the services available on the platform. In addition, internal and external services can be connected to the catalog – in some cases by using plugins, which are highly customizable tools. And if they need other resources, they can extend the catalog by creating new services with standards and best practices established by the organization. A good portal should allow and encourage developers to create their own services to personalize the DX to their team and organization’s specific needs and work style.

## Do I need a developer portal?

Developer portals are on their way to becoming an essential part of DX because they help developers do their job with less friction, feel more productive, and experiment safely. Cloud and service-oriented architectures are fueling this change from a traditional IT perspective to more flexible, autonomous, and self-administered tools.
