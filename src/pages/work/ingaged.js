          iNGAGED customers asked for help solving this problem and iNGAGED
          responded with this question. Would it decrease confusion and help
          with adoption and absorption if you were able to send personalized
          messaging with only relevant information to your employees? And would
          HR spend less time putting out fires if employees better understood
          their coverage?

          So iNGAGED teamed up with Frontside and created a strategy for
          enhancing their communications platform with these goals in mind.

          Frontside got to work immediately delivering features in the order of
          highest value first. But we didn’t stop there. Frontside provided
          further value by proceeding thoughtfully; analyzing and distilling
          certain features, and pushing to remove others altogether in order to
          ensure a viable product that remained within the constraints of
          timeline and budget.

          iNGAGED's engineering team entered the partnership with a robust
          development background on the backend and native devices, but we
          learned that they were hungry to expand their knowledge of JavaScript
          and Web technologies. We conducted frequent pair programming sessions
          with their engineers to clean up code, make it more sustainable, and
          layer in complete test coverage.

      <Testimonial name="Mike Wiles, CTO, iNGAGED" portrait={mike}>
        <Text tag="p">
          In terms of Illya's and my experience with Frontside, it was an
          incredibly positive. We sought out a partner with whom we'd have a
          strong alignment relative to the type of culture we're trying to
          create at iNGAGED as well as the tech chops to help us get the job
          done. Key to our desired culture was establishing a pair programming
          and test driven development environment using continuous integration.
          Given that we were in the infancy stage of our team, it was important
          that the partner we chose could not only participate in our culture
          but help us establish it. Needless to say when we started the partner
          selection process, I worried that we'd have to compromise somewhere in
          those requirements. Luckily for us the the Frontside ultimately met
          every single requirement we were looking for in a partner to help us
          deliver on our platform and meet our aggressive deadlines. Your team
          came in and helped us define high development standards, integrated
          seamlessly into our organization and delivered on every task we
          assigned. It was an absolute pleasure to work with you and your team.

        <Text tag="p">
          Illya and I both hope that the Frontside continues to grow and
          flourish as a provider of high end web experiences, encourage you to
          diversify into mobile and back end technologies and will happily be a
          reference for you and your team if needed.
