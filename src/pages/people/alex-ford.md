bio: Alex Ford is a Computer Engineer turned Developer. After dabbling in semiconductor design and low level programming, he realized "coding for the browser is just more fun than coding for anything else”. When he isn’t working on software, Alex is cycling, rock-climbing, kayaking and playing cribbage. Although he claims the wolf as his spirit animal, a meerkat is probably more accurate.
