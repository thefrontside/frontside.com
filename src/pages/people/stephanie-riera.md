bio: Texan born & raised in Europe, Stephanie received her degree in Molecular Biology and transitioned into programming a year after graduation. She loves programming because it provides the ability to create your own opportunities. Passionate about women's empowerment, she has organized the first Rails Girls in San Antonio, co-organized Emberitas in Austin, and is a firm believer in giving back to the community. Collecting vinyl, music festivals, and traveling are her favorite pastimes.
