If you work in Rails and have ever wondered about Ember.js, you should know that Ember and Rails go together like Nutella and pretzels. (Which is to say, quite well indeed.)

Get an inside look of the experience of going from having never tried Ember to shipping a production application in it. What makes Ember a good match for certain types of applications?

This talk is intended to help relative newcomers jump in and start seeing the kind of crazy-ambitious applications you can build when you've got Ember.js in your toolset.

**Note: The audio is rough, but gets a little better as the talk progresses. Sorry about that.**
