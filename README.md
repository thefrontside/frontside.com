# Frontside Website

This is the new Frontside website. It uses Gatsby for the blog, and pages generated from Webflow.


## Blog Development 

You can work on the blog with `yarn start`. Note, however, that you won't be able to see the static pages there.

## Webflow pages changes

If you want to make a change on a webflow pages (`static/index.html`, `static/about.html`, `static/consulting.html`, `static/tools.html`, `static/contact.html`, `static/contact-thanks.html`), open an issue or get in touch with @jorgelainfiesta (in Frontside's discord, twitter).

## Importing webflow generated files into the repo

At the moment we have a provisional manual process to adjust the webflow generated pages to what we need to work alongside gatsby. 

1. Download ZIP of files from webflow
2. Find and replace for all links in navs of the generated files from `*.html` to `/*` (done manually at the moment).
3. Find and replace all `target="_blank"` and replace with `target="_blank" rel="nofollow"`
4. Add hidden field to `contat.html` on top of the form element:
```
<input type="hidden" name="form-name" value="contact" />
<div hidden>
  <label>
    Donâ€™t fill this out:
    <input name="bot-field" onChange={this.handleChange} />
  </label>
</div>
```
5. Replace typekit's script loading for stylesheet.
```
<script src="https://use.typekit.net/gyc5wys.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
  <script type="text/javascript">try{Typekit.load();}catch(e){}</script>
```
for
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://use.typekit.net/gyc5wys.css" />
```
6. Copy + paste all the contents of the modified zip into `./static` (manually too)
4. Use `yarn build` to get the complete website in `./public/`
